BANKNIFTY LONG:
BankNifty Long system is an options trading strategy that buys Calls/Put Options as based on two Indicators:
1.	Option Premium as an Indicator or
2.	BankNifty Index as an Indicator
Both system versions have been tested, optimized and results saved.
This version will take Index Movement as an Entry Indicator and we will also trade next Expiry Symbols on the Expiry Day so that we do not get affected by the Time Decay.

Different entry/exit signals for the particular system-
Entry Signals: Based on Move in Index
Exit Signals: Next Day Morning Optimized Time
Expiry Symbol: Trading both Expiries on Expiry day and other days same expiry
