Along with Backtest Codes, there are a few Ancillary codes that form a part of the main Backtest Codes. These codes need to be updated from time to time:

1) **IncludeOK Code : -**
   This code is basically all the F&O Stocks that are / were a part of the F&O List along with their respective dates. This list is updated regularly.
   The spreadsheet where the code is can be found here E:\Dropboximac\Dropbox\Database Maintenance\FO Equity Daily on the E : Drive.
