## MONTHLY MEAN REVERSION (MMR):
Monthly mean reversion system is a futures trading strategy that buys top 10 futures as based on LTI Indicator:
1.	 lti = ROC(EMA(Close,EMALLB),llb) + ROC(EMA(Close,EMALLB+10),llb) + ROC(EMA(Close,EMALLB+20),llb)
1.	EMALLB = 10
2.	Llb = 10
According to the Daily ROC trend analysis on F&O list, there is an upward trend during the last 4-6 days till the end of month and the highest on the first day of the next month. (Refer to the sheet Dropbox\Study\Long Mean Reversion Daily ROC.xlsx)

**Mention the different entry/exit signals for the particular system-**<br/>
Stock selection: EQ symbols  (Rank = 30) First 10 stocks selected based on lti.<br/>
Currently run 3 systems with entry on 3 different days: 5, 4 and 3 days before month end. Since MMR positions are open only for the last 5 days of the month, the funds lie idle throughout the month. To avoid this, we combined BTST and MMR as one system and donâ€™t run BTST when MMR positions are about to open.<br/>
Entry Signals: low < btrig and time > 09:55am on Day1 and 09:15am from Day2.<br/>
Exit Signals: time = 093000 and day = 1st day of the next month<br/>
